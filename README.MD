I learned I learned how the Progressive Mobile Application architecture works for a text editor.  I learned how to implement the idb node package to store data within the browser for offline functionality.  I also used the node package concurrently to have two different package.json files.  I used different code for client side versus server side.  I learned how to use webpack and the service worker to allow for node packages to run within the front-end and allow install features..
